            <h2>Who is " Kevin Sackey "</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a Computer Science major at Stonehill College 
                and a Division I football student‑athlete. I grew up in Roslindale and Hyde Park before moving to 
                Randolph, MA, and each place has shaped who I am today. I’ve always been someone who works hard, 
                stays focused, and looks for ways to grow both academically, football wise and personally.

            <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My education has played a major role in my development. I began at Cathedral for elementary school, 
                then attended Boston Renaissance Charter Public School, where I graduated in 2017. I continued on to 
                the Academy of the Pacific Rim Charter Public School, graduating in 2024. I am now pursuing a 
                Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Stonehill College, with an anticipated graduation in 2028.

            <h2>My Athletic Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Athletics has always been a big part of my life. From competing in relay races from the age of five and particpating in 40‑yard dash 
                events to becoming a team captain in high school football, sports have taught me the need and responsibility of having discipline, leadership, 
                and resilience. Today, I’m proud to compete as a Division I football player at Stonehill College, where I can continue to push myself on and
                off the field. Most importanly, making my parents proud and hopefully one day retire them and treat to them to the best retirement life ever.

            <h2>What I’m Passionate About</h2>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about technology, problem‑solving, and helping others. Whether I’m working in IT 
                support at Mass General Hospital, contributing to AI training projects with handshake, or supporting youth 
                programs in Boston, I enjoy roles where I can make a positive impact. I’m always looking for ways 
                to learn new skills, challenge myself, and build a future in the tech world. That's why when I commited to
                Stonehill College, I told my dad " I'm going to change the world through Computer Science and Football just you wait ".

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to continue growing as a student, athlete, and future computer scientist. I’m excited 
                to keep building my skills, exploring new opportunities, and shaping a career that combines my 
                interests in technology, leadership, football, and my community that has helped shaped who I am today.
