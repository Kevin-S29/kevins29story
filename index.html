            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>
                I am <strong>Kevin B. Sackey</strong>, a Computer Science major at Stonehill College and a Division I 
                football student‑athlete. I'm from Randolph, MA, but I’ve mostly grown up in Roslindale and Hyde Park MA. 
                I’ve always been drawn to technology, problem‑solving, and helping others. I’ve worked in IT support at 
                Mass General Hospital, supported youth programs in Boston, and contributed to AI training projects. 
                I love learning new things, staying active, and finding ways to grow academically and personally as an athlete and a child of god. 
                This website is a place to share my journey, experiences, and the things I’m passionate about.
            </p>
